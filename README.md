# four-in-a-row

Four In A Row using [boardgame.io](https://github.com/google/boardgame.io), a simple project to demonstrate how to get up and running with boardgame.io. The current version is built using [board.gameio 0.32.1](https://boardgame.io/documentation/#/CHANGELOG?id=v0321).

For further information, see [this blog](https://www.lonesomecrowdedweb.com/blog/four-in-a-row-boardgameio/) that steps through how to set up such a project. Please note that it was originally written for an earlier version of boardgame.io, and there have since been breaking changes. Please see [this commit](https://github.com/PJohannessen/four-in-a-row/commit/22c70ebc9709cf00dee15f7d310eb327b0f43744) for the fixes required.
